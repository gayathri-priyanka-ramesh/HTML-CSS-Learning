# HTML & CSS Learning Repository
This repository contains the files I created while learning HTML and CSS from the "Logic First Tamil" YouTube Channel, which provided a comprehensive guide to understanding and building websites using HTML and CSS.

## What I Learned
- Basics of HTML, including elements, attributes, and document structure.
- Styling with CSS, including selectors, properties, and the box model.
- Building responsive layouts using Flexbox and Grid.
- Best practices for writing clean and maintainable code.

## Acknowledgements
